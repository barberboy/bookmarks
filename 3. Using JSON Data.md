Using JSON Data
===============
In lesson #2, we took a bit of a shortcut when we used our bookmarks collection by assigning it to the `bookmarks` property on the global `window` object. Setting global variables like that is not good practice for several reasons, but most critically:

1. We run the risk that other JavaScript might accidently clobber our data since all JavaScript on the page can access our data.
2. Storing the entire collection in memory will cause critical performance issues as our collection grows.

Eventually we will be storing our data in a database and will control access to that data using a web server. For now, we are going to keep are data in a static .json file and explore a couple of ways to access JSON data.Eventually

Creating bookmarks.json
-----------------------

    {
        "bookmarks" : [
            ...
        ]
    }


Loading JSON Data
------------------------------

    function renderBookmarks() {

    }


    function fetchBookmarks(callback) {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("get", "bookmarks.json", true);
        xhr.onload = function() {
            if (this.status == 200) {
                callback(JSON.parse(this.responseText).bookmarks);
            }
        };
        xhr.send();
    }
