Using JSON Data
===============
In lesson #2, we took a bit of a shortcut when we used our bookmarks collection by assigning it to the `bookmarks` property on the global `window` object. Setting global variables like that is not good practice for several reasons, but most critically:

1. We run the risk that other JavaScript might accidently clobber our data since all JavaScript on the page can access our data.
2. Storing the entire collection in memory will cause critical performance issues as our collection grows.

Eventually we will be storing our data in a database and will control access to that data using a web server. For now, we are going to keep are data in a static .json file and explore a couple of ways to access JSON data.

Using XMLHttpRequest
--------------------
In a [previous lesson][Defining our Data with JavaScript Object Notation] we created a [bookmarks.json] file to store our data. We are going to update our project to fetch the bookmark data using the XMLHttpRequest object, and parse it using JSON.parse().

The [XMLHttpRequest] object allows us to request data from our webserver without blocking the entire web application. The browser makes an asynchronous, non-blocking request for the data, and when the request completes, it will fire a callback function and provide us with access to the data in the response.

Using the XMLHttpRequest object is relatively straightforward:

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('get', 'bookmarks.json', true);
    xhr.onload = function() {
        console.log( this.responseText );
    };
    xhr.send();

The above code creates a new XMLHttpRequest Object that will make a `get` request for the 'bookmarks.json' file. The third parameter to the `.open()` method says to make this an *asynchronous* request.

One line three, we are registering our 'onload' callback, which will be fired when we receive a response from the server. The final line fires off the request.

Parsing the responseText with JSON.parse()
------------------------------------------
When our `onload` callback is fired, `this.responseText` will contain the text of our bookmarks.json file as a String. In order to use that text, we need to convert it first to a JavaScript Object.

The [`JSON` global object][JSON] provides a quick and convenient way to convert a String of JSON data to a JavaScript object, as well as convert a JavaScript Object to a String. We'll be using it often in our project.

[JSON.parse] takes a String of JSON data and returns a JavaScript object. For instance, we could do:

    var text = '[{"message":"Hello!"}, {"message":"Goodbye!"}]';
    var messages = JSON.parse( text );
    messages.forEach(function(item){
        console.log(item.message);
    });

In our `onload` callback, we are going to parse the `responseText` to create an array of bookmarks data, then pass that data to our `renderBookmarks` method:

    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('get', 'bookmarks.json', true);
    xhr.onload = function() {
        var bookmarks = JSON.parse( this.responseText );
        renderBookmarksWithTemplate( bookmarks );
    };
    xhr.send();

Creating a getJSON function
---------------------------
To make things a bit more organized, we are going to create a simple utility function that will make an XMLHttpRequest and parse the response as JSON:

    /**
     * getJSON( path, callback )
     * -------------------------
     * Asynchronously fetch and parse a JSON file.
     *
     * - path:             A String specifying the location of the JSON file.
     * - callback( data ): A Function to be executed when the JSON file is retrieved
     *                     and parsed. The function will be passed the parsed json
     *                     data.
     *
     * Returns undefined.
     */
    function getJSON(path, callback) {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('get', path, true);
        xhr.onload = function() {
            var data = JSON.parse( this.responseText );
            callback( data );
        };
        xhr.send();
    }

This looks very similar to our earlier code, but it is more flexible and can be reused in other parts of our application.

We would use our getJSON function by passing 'bookmarks.json' as the path, and the function `renderBookmarksWithTemplate` as the callback:

    getJSON('bookmarks.json', renderBookmarksWithTemplate);

Loading the data with JSONP
---------------------------
JSONP stands for 'JSON with padding', and provides an alternative way to use JSON data. With the JSONP pattern, we wrap our JSON data inside a function, and then include the file in the page using a `script` element.

We are going to repurpose our 'bookmarks.js' file and turn it into a JSONP file. To do that remove the `window.bookmarks = ` on the first line and replace it with the function call: `renderBookmarks(`, and add the closing parenthesis after the closing square bracket on the last line. The result will look something like this:

    renderBookmarks([{
        "id": 1,
        "url": "https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics",
        "title": "Atlassian's Git Tutorial",
        // trimmed for clarity...
    }]);

See the full example in [bookmarks.js].

When the browser loads this file, it will call the `renderBookmarks` function and pass it the Array of bookmarks. That means we only need to do two additional things to use our JSONP file.

1. Define a `renderBookmarks` function. Since we already have a `renderBookmarksWithTemplate` function, we can simply make renderBookmarks an alias to that function. In 'loadBookmarks.js': 

       window.renderBookmarks = renderBookmarksWithTemplate;

2. Update 'index.html' to include 'bookmarks.js' *after* 'loadBookmarks.js'.

Creating a getJSONP function
----------------------------
If we wanted, we could create a getJSONP utility function similar to our getJSON function. All it needs to do is create a new `script` element and append it to the page:

    /**
     * getJSONP( path )
     * ----------------
     * Asynchronously load a JSONP file.
     *
     * - path: A String specifying the location of the JSONP file.
     *
     * Returns undefined.
     */
    function getJSONP(path) {
        var script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = path;
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    }

We would use this in our application like:

    getJSONP('bookmarks.js');

Cleaning up our project
-----------------------
One final step that we'll take is to add a bit of organization to our project. For now, let's just create a 'util.js' file and put the definitions for our 'getJSON' and 'getJSONP' functions in that file. Be sure to also update index.html to include 'util.js' *before* loadBookmarks.js.

Homework
--------
1. Read [Using XMLHttpRequest][XMLHttpRequest] and the documentation for the [JSON global object][JSON] and [JSON.parse].
2. Implement a `getJSON` method that fetches a `.json` file using the XMLHttpRequest object, parses the responseText using JSON.parse(), and passes the resulting data to a callback function. Update your project to demonstrate how you would use the getJSON() method to find and process your application's data.
3. Implement a `getJSONP` method that requests and processes a JSONP-style document.
4. Update your project to render your application data using JSONP.
5. Commit the changes to your project and push them to github.
6. Update your project to use [precompiled Handlebars templates].
7. Commit the changes to your project and push to github.
8. Read through chapter 3 in _Web Development with Node & Express_.
9. Be awesome.
