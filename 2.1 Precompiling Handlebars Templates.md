Precompiling Handlebars Templates
=================================
Precompiling Handlebars templates provides a few benefits over dynamic compilation:

1. By compiling templates during the build process we eliminate the runtime cost of template compilation.
2. Since we don't need dynamic compilation support, we can use the smaller 'handlebars.runtime.js' which is less than 1⁄4 the size of the full Handlebars library.
3. We can better organize our template source files since they don't need to be inside `<script type="text/x-handlebars-template">...</script>` elements in our HTML.

Installing the `handlebars` executable
--------------------------------------
The `handlebars` executable can be installed using `npm` by running:

    npm install -g handlebars

NPM is the node package manager and it comes with Node.js. If it isn't available on your system, you'll need to [install node](http://nodejs.org/download/). Node and npm are already installed on http://c9.io workspaces.


Using the `handlebars` executable
---------------------------------
The first step in precompiling our bookmark template is to create a new `bookmark.handlebars` file that contains the template source:

    <article class="bookmark">
        <h1><a class="bookmark" href="{{url}}" title="{{title}}">{{title}}</a></h1>
        {{#if description}}
            <p class="description">{{description}}</p>
        {{/if}}
    </article>

Now we use the `handlebars` executable to generate a .js file containing our compiled template function:

    handlebars bookmark.handlebars --output templates.js

`handlebars` will compile the .handlebars source file into a JavaScript function, and assign that function to `Handlebars.templates.bookmark` inside our 'templates.js' file.


Using handlebars.runtime.js
---------------------------
Since we don't need the dynamic compilation features of the full Handlebars library, we can use the handlebars.runtime.js instead. You can download it by going to http://handlebarsjs.com/, and clicking "Download: runtime-2.0.0" right *below* the big orange "Download 2.0.0" button.

The Handlebars runtime needs to be loaded *before* our templates.js file.


Accessing the compiled template
-------------------------------
The new 'templates.js' file defines the property `Handlebars.templates.bookmark`. The name of the property (in this case 'bookmark') is based on the filename of the source template, and will be everything **before** the file extension. For instance, if the filename was `bookmarkTemplate.handlebars`, the property will be `Handlebars.templates.bookmarkTemplate`.


Using the compiled template
---------------------------
The compiled template function takes a context object and returns the generated HTML, like:

    var html = Handlebars.templates.bookmark({title:”Pancakes", url:”http://example.com/pancakes”});

You can also pass this function directly to 'map' to generate the HTML for each of your elements if you'd like:

    bookmarks.map( Handlebars.templates.bookmark ).forEach(function( html ){
        container.innerHTML += html;
    });

_Don’t forget to update your application JavaScript to use your compiled function *instead of* calling Handlebars.compile( source ). Also, don’t forget to remove the unnecessary `<script id="bookmarks-template">...</script>` from your index.html file._


Additional notes
----------------

### Using Alternate file Extensions

The `handlebars` executable assumes that you are using the extension '.handlebars' for your template source files. If you want to use the extension '.html', you’ll have to use the '-e' or '--extension' option, e.g.:

    handlebars bookmark.html --extension html --output templates.js

If your template source has the extension .html and you **forget** to use the `--extension html` option, your template will stored at `Handlebars.templates["bookmarkTemplate.html"]` which is just sad and inconvenient.

### Generating smaller template.js files

There are additional compiler options documented at <https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/#installation>. Some convenient ones for smaller template files are `--min` and `--knownOnly`.

    handlebars bookmarks.handlebars --knownOnly --min --output templates.js
