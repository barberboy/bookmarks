Introduction
------------

Greetings, developers! We're setting out on an exploration of the technologies that power the world wide web. We have grand ambitions to master HTML, JavaScript, & CSS, and to learn the fundamentals necessary to create powerful, scalable web applications using some common web frameworks.

Our reference application will be a social bookmarking service that will allow people to keep track of the interesting web sites, articles, videos, images, and books that they run across on the web.

<!--TODO: Provide overview and screenshots of the completed application once it's completed -->

Project Description
-------------------
The project is a simple, social bookmarking service that allows users to keep track of their favorite places on the web. It provides a simple and beautiful listing of bookmarks, and provides the capability to search, sort, tag, favorite, and share their collection of links.

Each bookmark has the following properties:

- id - A String representing the system-generated unique identifier
- url - A String containing the URL of the bookmarked item
- created - A Date representing the date and time the user created the bookmark
- description - A String containing a plain-text description of the item

Possible future properties:

- snippet - A String of HTML containing a quote or brief snippet of the item
- thumbnail - A String containing a reference to a small preview image of the item
- archive - A String containing a reference to a permanently archived version of the item.

Approach
--------
We will be building this bookmarking system from the ground up in several stages:

1. [Defining our Data with JavaScript Object Notation]
2. [Generating HTML from JavaScript]
3. [Using JSON Data]
4. Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete
5. Using Handlebars to render the data
6. Storing Data on the Server using Node.js
6. Using a Database for data storage
7. Adding Routes for viewing, searching, sharing
8. Adding user authentication
9. Multi-user support
10. Implementing an API
11. Creating multiple API clients
12. Optimizing for performance

Homework 1 â€” Create a New Project
---------------------------------
1. Create a new c9.io workspace for your individual project.
2. Initialize a new Git repository for your project.
3. Create a README.md file that provides a brief description of your project.
4. Define the 'atomic unit' for your project, and model it using a simple schema. See `bookmarkSchema.js` as a reference.
5. Define (approximately) the HTML representation for your data model. See `bookmarkTemplate.html` as a reference.
6. Create an index.html that lists out a few examples of your data.
7. Add and commit your README.md, index.html, schema.js, and template.html files.
