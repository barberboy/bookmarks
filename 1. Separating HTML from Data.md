Separating HTML from Data
=========================
In the homework for the introduction, we created an index.html file containing a few examples of what our data might look like when rendered as HTML. In this assignment, we'll transition to storing our data directly as JavaScript, and transform that data into HTML.

The first step is to store our data using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON); the second step will be to iterate through that data and dynamically build our HTML response.

JavaScript Object Literals
--------------------------
One of the most flexible construct in the JavaScript programming language is the object literal. The [object literal in JavaScript] is similar to [Python's dictionary] or [Ruby's hash], and is a collection of keys and their associated values.

An empty object literal is simply a pair of curly braces (`{}`). Inside the curly braces are property names and their associated values separated by a comma. Multiple properties are separated by a comma.

In the example below, the variable `car` is an object that has the property `make` with a value of `"Honda"`, and the property `model` with the value `"Accord"`:

    var car = {
        make: "Honda",
        model: "Accord"
    };

Keys in a JavaScript object literal can optionally be quoted, such as:

    var car = {
        "make": "Honda",
        "model": "Accord"
    };

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
---------------------------------
[JavaScript Object Notation], or JSON, is a data interchange format that provides a way of describing data using standard JavaScript notation.

The two primary datatypes in JSON are

1. Objects, to represent a collection of key/value properties, and
2. Arrays, to represent an ordered list of values.

If we wanted to specify an inventory of cars, for instance, we could represent it in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as:

    [{
        "make" : "Honda",
        "model" : "Accord",
        "year" : 2010
    }, {
        "make" : "Toyota",
        "model" : "Camry",
        "year" : 2005
    }, {
        "make" : "Toyota",
        "model" : "Corola",
        "year" : 2015
    }]

While quoting keys is optional for regular JavaScript object literals, JSON requires that keys be quoted using double-quotes (e.g. "name").

Homework - Defining your data in JavaScript
-------------------------------------------
1. Read the JSON specification at http://json.org
2. Create a .json file that contains a sample of real data for your application. See [bookmarks.json](bookmarks.json) as an example.
